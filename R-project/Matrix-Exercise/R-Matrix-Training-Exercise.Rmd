## **R Matrix Exercises**

##### Author: Suchanya Namwong

\

Through these exercises we will review the matrix data structure and perhaps introduce you to a few ideas for you to discover on your own!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Create 2 vectors A and B, where A is (1,2,3) and B is (4,5,6). With these vectors, use the `cbind()` or `rbind()` function to create a 2 by 3 matrix from the vectors. You'll need to figure out which of these binding functions is the correct choice.**

First, create 2 vectors A and B

```{r}
A <- c(1,2,3)
B <- c(4,5,6)
```

Then, to create a 2 by 3 matrix from `rbind()` function

```{r}
rbind(A,B)
```

\
**Create a 3 by 3 matrix consisting of the numbers 1-9. Assign this matrix to the variable *`mat`***

First, create a vector consisting of the number 1-9

```{r}
n <- 1:9
n
```

Then, convert the vector into a 3 by 3 matrix and name it `mat`.

```{r}
mat <- matrix(n, nrow = 3)
mat
```

\
**Confirm that *`mat`* is a matrix.**

```{r}
is.matrix(mat)
```

\
**Create a 5 by 5 matrix consisting of the numbers 1-25 and assign it to the variable *`mat2`*. The top row should be the numbers 1-5.**

```{r}
v <- 1:25
mat2 <- matrix(v, ncol = 5, byrow = 1)
mat2
```

\
**Using indexing notation, grab a sub-section of *`mat2`* from the previous exercise that looks like this:**

```{r}
mat2
```

```{r}
mat2[2:3, 2:3]
```

\
**Using indexing notation, grab a sub-section of *`mat2`* from the previous exercise that looks like this:**

![](C:/Users/ADV_MSI/AppData/Local/RStudio/tmp/paste-49718AA7.png)

```{r}
mat2
```

```{r}
mat2[4:5, 4:5]
```

\
**What is the sum of all the elements in *`mat2`*?**

```{r}
sum(mat2)
```

\
**Find out how to use `runif()` to create a 4 by 5 matrix consisting of 20 random numbers.**

```{r}
randnum <- runif(20, min = 10, max = 100)
matrix(randnum, nrow = 4)
```
